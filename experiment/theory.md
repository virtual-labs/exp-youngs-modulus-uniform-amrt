### theory

Young's modulus is named after Thomas Young,19th century ,British scientist. In solid mechanics, Young's modulus is defines as the ratio of the longitudinal  stress over longitudinal strain, in the range of elasticity  the Hook's law holds (stress is directly proportional to strain). It is a measure of stiffness of elastic material.

If a wire of length L and area of cross-section 'a' be stretched by a force F and if a change (increase) of length 'l' is produced, then
